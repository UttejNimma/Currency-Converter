Developed a dynamic web application for converting currency amounts between countries using real-time exchange rates fetched from an API. 
Technologies Used: Structured the page with HTML/CSS for basic styling. Implemented core functionality in JavaScript to fetch and dynamically populate currency dropdowns from REST Countries and Exchange Rate APIs, successfully integrating multiple APIs for conversion. 
Features: Searchable dropdowns for currency selection, dynamic conversion results based on user input, and input 
validation to allow only integer values.  Challenges: Handled and parsed API data to accurately populate dropdowns, and managed asynchronous JavaScript to ensure conversions occurred only after successful data retrieval.
